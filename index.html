    <h2>Project 1: Slime Madness</h2>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>2D Platformer, written in C</h3>
      <p>
        Slime Madness is a 2d platformer, with unique character manipulation mechanics.  The controlled player character can be split at will, and the player can select portions of itself to control.
        This project was developed entirely in C.  We used a now open source graphics library, CProcessing (https://github.com/DigiPen-Faculty/CProcessing).  Audio implementation was completed using FMOD.
        My contribution to this project was gameplay development.  I implemented the player controller functionality.

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
          <p>
            FFlap began life under a different name, The Ballad of Finn.  This was the first project that I produced.  I stepped up to the plate, ascending from Associate Producer to Producer, when it became apparent that my Producer wasn't going to be able to handle the workload.
            This project was developed in C++, using CMake, GLFW, and FMOD.

    <h2>Project 5: Apocalypse Resort</h2>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          I joined Apocalypse Resort for one semester.  During my time on this project, I implemented a telemetry logging solution to provide hard data for the psychology researcher we were building this project for.
          This was my first experience with the Unreal Engine.  Being thrown into a legacy project and finding myself needing to integrate into many of the games systems to log the data specfied.  I learned significantly more tan I would have in any other introduction to this engine.

        <ul>
          <li>Robust telemetry toolset</li>
          <li>Data Post Processing Workflow (CSV, Python, Excel) </li>
          <li>Player controller behavior improvements</li>
